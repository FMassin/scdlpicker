If the initial source depth is very wrong, e.g. 500 km vs. 10 km,
then two problems arise:

- The picking based on the "predicted" pick arrival may
  work but the resulting pick is too far off the prediction and the
  pick will be skipped due to the too-large time difference.

- The predicted pick time of an early origin with wrong depth is not
  updated with consolidating source depth. Even a very good pick
  will therefore be rejected and there is no way out.

Test-Event e.g. gfz2022fpfe.

Solution: The client needs to update the predicted arrival time for
each and every origin.
